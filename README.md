# Intro
PaperGuardian is my Diploma Project, designed for Paper Format Detection and Paper Peer Review.

The project can be divided into four moduls
- **PaperLoader**: Load and preprocess papers for subsequent testing and analysis(docx,pdf)
- **FormatDetection**: Check the format of the paper according to the specified requirements
- **PeerReview**: Evaluate the content and quality of articles through multi-module collaboration and give corresponding suggestions
- **Visual**: Offer an interactive GUI (Gradio) 

To Enable stability of the codeï¼Œ we use ipynb to test some feat in [Folder Test](./Test) and the TestPaper are placed in [Folder TestPaper](./TestPaper/)
